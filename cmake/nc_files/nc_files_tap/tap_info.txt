Orignal lcnc planner :

There is one thing that would be really good for rigid tapping.

Currently the rigid tapping overshoots the bottom of the hole because it doesn't know how long spindle takes to stop so you program.

Like this 

S300m3
G0z0
G33.1 z-20 k1.5(1.5mm pitch for m10 tap)

And the tap will actually go 22mm deep as it doesn't know how long spindle will take to reverse 

On my machine it takes about 2mm at 300 rpm.

So that's about 1.5 spindle rotations
